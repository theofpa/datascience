    "# **Math and Python review and CTR data download**\n",
    "#### This notebook reviews vector and matrix math, the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) Python package, and Python lambda expressions.  It also covers downloading the data required for Lab 4, where you will analyze website click-through rates.  Part 1 covers vector and matrix math, and you'll do a few exercises by hand.  In Part 2, you'll learn about NumPy and use `ndarray` objects to solve the math exercises.   Part 3 provides additional information about NumPy and how it relates to array usage in Spark's [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/).  Part 4 provides an overview of lambda expressions, and you'll wrap up by downloading the dataset for Lab 4.\n",
    "#### To move through the notebook just run each of the cells.  You can run a cell by pressing \"shift-enter\", which will compute the current cell and advance to the next cell, or by clicking in a cell and pressing \"control-enter\", which will compute the current cell and remain in that cell.  You should move through the notebook from top to bottom and run all of the cells.  If you skip some cells, later cells might not work as expected.\n",
    "#### Note that there are several exercises within this notebook.  You will need to provide solutions for cells that start with: `# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code`.\n",

In that case, the lambda expression generates a function that is bound to the parameter being passed into the function.\n",

In short, this means that the lambda expression needs to evaluate to a value and exist on a single logical line.  If more complex logic is necessary, use `def` in place of `lambda`.\n",

Also, note that assignment statements (`=`) and augmented assignment statements (e.g. `+=`) cannot be used either."

    "#### ** (4e) Functional programming **\n",
    "#### The `lambda` examples we have shown so far have been somewhat contrived.  This is because they were created to demonstrate the differences and similarities between `lambda` and `def`.  An excellent use case for lambda expressions is functional programming.  In functional programming, you will often pass functions to other functions as parameters, and `lambda` can be used to reduce the amount of code necessary and to make the code more readable.\n",
    "#### Some commonly used functions in functional programming are map, filter, and reduce.  Map transforms a series of elements by applying a function individually to each element in the series.  It then returns the series of transformed elements.  Filter also applies a function individually to each element in a series; however, with filter, this function evaluates to `True` or `False` and only elements that evaluate to `True` are retained.  Finally, reduce operates on pairs of elements in a series.  It applies a function that takes in two values and returns a single value.  Using this function, reduce is able to, iteratively, \"reduce\" a series to a single value.\n",
    "####  For this exercise, you'll create three simple `lambda` functions, one each for use in map, filter, and reduce.  The map `lambda` will multiply its input by 5, the filter `lambda` will evaluate to `True` for even numbers, and the reduce `lambda` will add two numbers.  Note that we have created a class called `FunctionalWrapper` so that the syntax for this exercise matches the syntax you'll see in PySpark.\n",
    "#### Note that map requires a one parameter function that returns a new value, filter requires a one parameter function that returns `True` or `False`, and reduce requires a two parameter function that combines the two parameters and returns a new value."

For example, `dataset.map(f1).filter(f2).reduce(f3)`, where `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` are functions or lambda expressions, first applies a map operation to `dataset`, then filters the result from map, and finally reduces the result from the first two operations.\n",

It's likely you've seen chaining used with Python strings.  For example, `'Split this'.lower().split(' ')` first returns a new string object `'split this'` and then `split(' ')` is called on that string to produce `['split', 'this']`.\n",
